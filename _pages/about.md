David Brown, PhD
======  
I am a Post-Doctoral Associate at the EQUAL Lab within the School of Integrative Plant Sciences, Plant Breeding and Genetics Section, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. I work on the development and application of data synthesis approaches to produce location-specific information to support decision making in crop variety management. In my work, I collaborate with a multidisciplinary group of scientists in the NextGen Cassava project in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, and with the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement in Costa Rica. 

Research Interests
======
My main research interest is on how geographical factors affect crop variety performance from the perspective of farmers as end users. In that sense, I am also interested in understanding how farmers take decisions about what, when and where to plant, considering their geographical and socioeconomic context, in order to develop methods and tools that provide them tailored information to support farm decision making.
